# GO Bank

![Golang Bank](golang_bank.png "Golang Bank")

This app is very simple, I made it in go oriented object course. I'm really loved Golang after this. In this app I create a local app from zero inside main conventions applying structs, composition of inheritance and encapsulation with code modularization.
